# This workflow runs on pushes to the main branch and for pull requests.

    branches: [ main ]

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x] # Test against two major Node.js versions

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./backend # All commands will run in the backend folder

    steps:
      # 1. Get the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up the specified Node.js version
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}

        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: backend/package-lock.json

      # 3. Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'ci' is faster and safer for pipelines than 'install'

      # 4. Run the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors and build the project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Note: A true test would involve spinning up a test database and running
      # an actual test suite (e.g., with Jest). For this assignment's scope,
      # successfully building the project serves as a basic "test".
